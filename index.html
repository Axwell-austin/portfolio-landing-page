        <p>I am simple guy and i could
            best describe myself as a 
            martyr of life uncertainty.
            I am currently stydying at 
            Moringa School. I have
            previously been at Dr. Steury
            primary school, Tenwek 
            high school then at Kabarak
            University where I will be 
            pursuing my bachelor’s
            degree. I have a big interest
            in Software Development
            and that is the major reason
            why I decided to take a class 
            on Programming.</p>
